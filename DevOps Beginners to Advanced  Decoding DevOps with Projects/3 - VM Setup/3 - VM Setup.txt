To ssh into a VM from GitBash
Enable Network Adapter 2 and attach to Bridged Adapter
Now the VM will fetch IP address from the wifi router 
Next do follwing 

Check SSH Service:
Ensure the SSH service is installed and running on the Ubuntu VM.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh

Firewall Settings:
Make sure the firewall allows SSH connections.
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status

Confirm IP and Port:
Verify the IP address and ensure port 22 is open.
ifconfig
netstat -tuln | grep 22

After performing these steps, try SSH again from Git Bash:
ssh <vm-username>@<vm-public-ip>
ssh username@192.168.1.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now to setup alias for ssh username@192.168.1.12
Open Git Bash.

Edit the ~/.bashrc file to add your alias:
nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line at the end of the file:
alias myssh='ssh username@192.168.1.12'

Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

Apply the changes:
source ~/.bashrc

Now just type myssh to login
To see all aliases type alias
-----------------------------------------
To set up passwordless SSH login, you need to generate an SSH key pair on your Windows laptop and add the public key to your Ubuntu VM. Here’s how to do it:
Option1: ssh-copy-id username@192.168.1.12
Option2: Copy public key and paste it under authorized keys of VM 

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo 'your-copied-public-key' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

To configure SSH to automatically use a specific username when connecting to an IP address, you can set up an SSH configuration file. Here’s how to do it:

Open Git Bash.

Edit the SSH config file (create it if it doesn't exist):
nano ~/.ssh/config

Add the following configuration:
Host youralias
    HostName 192.168.1.12
    User yourusername

Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

Replace youralias with a name you want to use (e.g., myvm), 192.168.1.12 with the IP address of your Ubuntu VM, and yourusername with your Ubuntu VM username.
-----------------------
To run sudo commands without being prompted for a password, you need to configure the sudoers file. Here's how to do it:
sudo visudo
At the end of the file, add:
ashok ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
-----------------------
To disable password-based login and allow only SSH key-based login, follow these steps:
Open the SSH configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Disable password authentication:
Find the following lines and set them as follows:
PasswordAuthentication no

Save and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart ssh
-----------------------
To enable both password-based and SSH key-based login, ensure your SSH configuration file allows both methods. Here’s how to do it:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Ensure the following lines are set appropriately:
PasswordAuthentication yes
PubkeyAuthentication yes

Save and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
sudo systemctl restart ssh
